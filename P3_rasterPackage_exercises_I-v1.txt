### Exercises with raster data (parts 1-2)

Geospatial data is becoming increasingly used to solve numerous 'real-life' problems (check 
out some examples <a href="http://gisgeography.com/gis-applications-uses/">here</a>). In turn, 
R is becoming a powerful open-source solution to handle this type of data, currently providing 
an exceptional range of functions and tools for GIS and Remote Sensing data analysis.

In particular, <strong>raster data</strong> provides support for representing spatial phenomena 
by diving the surface into a grid (or matrix) composed by cells of regular size. Each raster 
dataset has a certain number of columns and rows and each cell contains a value with information 
for the variable of interest. Stored data can be either: (i) thematic - representing a 
<strong>discrete</strong> variable (e.g., land cover classification map) or 
<strong>continuous</strong> (e.g., elevation).

The `raster` package currently provides an extensive set of functions to create, read, export, 
manipulate and process raster datasets. It also provides low-level functionalities for creating 
more advanced processing chains as well as the ability to manage large datasets. For more 
information see: <code>vignette("functions", package = "raster")</code>.

Start by downloading, uncompressing and loading the sample data for these exercises from this 
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/srtm_pnpg.zip">link</a> 
(digital elevation model data from SRTM-v4.1 for the Peneda-Geres National Park, Portugal). The data is in GeoTIFF 
format with name srtm_pnpg.tif.


<strong>Exercise 1</strong>
-> Check out the size of the data in terms of number of rows, columns, cells and layers.


<strong>Exercise 2</strong>
-> Check the spatial resolution of the raster and its coordinate reference system (CRS).


<strong>Exercise 3</strong>
-> Get the raster extent object and calculate the 'height' (in the y-axis) and the length (in x-axis) of the raster. 


<strong>Exercise 4</strong>
-> Calculate the mean and standard-deviation for all pixels.


<strong>Exercise 5</strong>
-> Calculate the 1%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 99% quantiles for all pixels.


<strong>Exercise 6</strong>
-> Using a QQ-plot investigate deviations from normality in the distribution of elevation values.


<strong>Exercise 7</strong>
-> Extract raster values for 100 randomly generated points within the image (use <code>set.seed(12345)</code>) 
for obtaining the same values as in the solutions).


<strong>Exercise 8</strong>
-> Convert the elevation units of the DEM from meters to feet. Make a RasterStack object with both the raster 
with meters (original) and feet (new).


<strong>Exercise 9</strong>
-> Crop the raster to the following extent: Upper-left {ymax = 4654705, xmin = 554615}, and, 
Lower-right {ymin = 4618355, xmax = 589015}.


<strong>Exercise 10</strong>
-> Reproject the sample raster to Datum ETRS 1989 (European Terrestrial Reference System 1989), projection Lambert 
Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) and change the resolution to 100m with bilinear method.
