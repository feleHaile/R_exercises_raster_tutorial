### Background 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the third part of this tutorial series on spatial data analysis using the `raster` package, 
we will explore more functionalities, namely:        
    
   * Masking,    
   * Aggregation,
   * Zonal analysis, and,
   * Cross-tabulation.

For more information on raster data processing see [here](http://r-exercises.com/tags/raster-data), as well as the [tutorial part-1](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/11/29/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-1), and, [tutorial part-2](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/12/13/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-2) of this 
series.


### Raster masking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Masking a raster is often required when we want to represent and/or analyze only the pixels included in 
a specific area or region. In turn, the remaining pixels are transformed into `NA`'s (or other 
user-defined value).  

For this purpose we can use the `mask` function. This requires to input a 'mask' layer that can be 
either a `Raster*` object (with the same extent and resolution), or a `Spatial*` object (e.g., 
`SpatialPolygons`) in which case, all cells that are not covered by this object are set to `updatevalue` 
(`NA` by default).    

We will start by downloading, uncompressing and loading the sample data. A `SpatialPolygons*` layer will 
be used as the mask layer. The objective of this example is to mask elevation values that are inside 
the Peneda-Geres National Park (NW Portugal). First up, let's prepare the elevation data:

```{r P4_read_raster_dem, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(raster)

## Create a folder named data-raw inside the working directory to place downloaded data
if(!dir.exists("./data-raw")) dir.create("./data-raw")

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/srtm_pnpg.zip", "./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

rst <- raster("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.tif")


```

Now, let's download and read the mask layer (using `rgdal`):

```{r P4_read_masl_layer, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(sp)
library(rgdal)


## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", "./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

# Read the mask layer and convert it to a 'simpler' SpatialPolygons dataset
maskLayer <- as(readOGR(dsn = "./data-raw", layer = "pnpg_bounds"), "SpatialPolygons")


```


Plot the data to see if everything is OK:

```{r P4_plot_data, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

plot(rst, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_plot_data-1.png)


Finally, let's mask the values for the PG National Park boundaries:

```{r P4_mask_raster, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

rstMasked <- mask(rst, maskLayer)

plot(rstMasked, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_mask_raster-1.png)


From the image, we can see that only pixels occurring inside the Park are represented 
or 'masked'. Exactly what we wanted! `r emo::ji("smile")` `r emo::ji("thumbsup")` `r emo::ji("wink")`


### Raster aggregation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raster aggregation is the process of creating a new `RasterLayer` by grouping cell values in 
a rectangular area to create larger/coarser cells. This grouping can employ any user-defined function to 
summarize multiple values (in the rectangular area) and provide a single value (e.g., mean, sd, min, 
max, sum). This 'upsampling' allows to represent and analyze the spatial distribution of cell values 
inside each rectangular area.      

The `aggregate` function will be used for this purpose. The 'coarseness' of the aggregation is controlled 
by the `fact` parameter (aggregation factor) which expresses the number of cells in each direction (horizontal 
and vertical). Alternatively, two integers can be used to separately express the horizontal and vertical 
aggregation factors.      

Let's see how this works out with different aggregation factors:

    * Aggregation factor 2 - pixel size 160(m)
    * Aggregation factor 7 - pixel size 560(m)


```{r P4_raster_aggregation, fig.width=7, fig.height=7, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

# Aggregation factor = 2
rstAggFact2Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = mean)
rstAggFact2SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = sd)

# Aggregation factor = 7
rstAggFact7Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = mean)
rstAggFact7SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = sd)

# Plot the newly aggregated rasters
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(rstAggFact2Mean, main = "Aggregation factor = 2 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact2SD, main = "Aggregation factor = 2 | SD")

plot(rstAggFact7Mean, main = "Aggregation factor = 7 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact7SD, main = "Aggregation factor = 7 | SD")

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_raster_aggregation-1.png)

Notice the change in coarseness as we move from an aggregation factor of 2 to 7, with much less 
detail in the latter. In this particular example (a DEM analysis), and for larger factors, it allows 
us to understand general land-forms (mean) and also topographic heterogeneity (standard-deviation).


### Zonal analysis

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this part of the tutorial we will address zonal analysis. This method allows to summarize the values in a
`Raster*` object for each "zone" included in a `RasterLayer` (typically defined by an integer code). 
The `zonal` function is used for this objective. Notice that both `Raster*` input objects must have the same 
extent, resolution, and, CRS.

Applications of this technique include summarizing cell values for administrative regions 
(like in the example explored below) or, calculating summary statistics for raster segments (useful in an 
object-based image analysis approach).     

In the example we will calculate zonal statistics for elevation data for each civil parish (N=17) 
within the Peneda-Geres National Park (PGNP - NW Portugal).    

As customary, we will start by downloading, uncompressing and loading civil parish data:

```{r P4_civil_parish_data_load}

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", "./data-raw/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")
rstCivPar <- raster("./data-raw/PNPG_CivilParishes.tif")
```

Plot the data to see if it's OK:

```{r P4_civil_parish_data_plot, fig.width=7.5, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(rst, main="Elevation (meters)")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)
plot(rstCivPar, main="Civil parishes PGNP")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_civil_parish_data_plot-1.png)


We can now calculate elevation statistics for each civil parish (identified by an 
integer number). `zonal` accepts summarizing functions (in argument `fun`) 
with single or multiple outputs. In the example below we will calculate the mean.

```{r P4_calc_raster_zonal_stats1}

# Single-output
zonal(rst, rstCivPar, fun=mean)

```

In the next example, column #1 equals the median and column #2 the median-absolute deviation which 
is obtained by a specific multi-output function:

```{r P4_calc_raster_zonal_stats2}

# Multi-output
zonal(rst, rstCivPar, fun=function(x,...) c(MED=median(x,...), MAD=mad(x,...)))

```


### Cross-tabulation of two discrete/categorical raster datasets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performing a cross-tabulation of two raster datasets is very useful when, for example, you want 
to assess land cover changes between two different dates. It is also a preliminary step for generating a 
confusion matrix from which several classification performance metrics can be calculated.          

In this example, we will use Corine Land Cover (CLC), a dataset from the European Environmental Agency 
(EEA) for years 2006 and 2012, to analyze changes in land cover composition. In this case, we have two categorical 
rasters with integer values corresponding to different land cover classes (see details in the table below). 

```{r P4_CLC_Codes}

clcLeg <- read.csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/legend_clc.csv"),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

clcLeg <- data.frame(clcLeg[,1:2], 
                CLC_abr=toupper(abbreviate(gsub("-"," ",clcLeg[,3]), 6)), 
                Label=clcLeg[,3], row.names = 1:nrow(clcLeg))

knitr::kable(clcLeg)

```

Now, let's download, uncompress and load the raster data into R and then perform the 
cross-tabulation:

```{r P4_load_CLC_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/CLC_06_12.zip", "./data-raw/CLC_06_12.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/CLC_06_12.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

# Load the Corine Land cover dataset for 2006 and 2012
clc06 <- raster("./data-raw/clc2006_100m.tif")
clc12 <- raster("./data-raw/clc2012_100m.tif")

# 'Ratify' the rasters, i.e., inform that these are 
# categorical/discrete datasets
clc06 <- ratify(clc06)
clc12 <- ratify(clc12)

# Perform the crosstab
ct <- crosstab(clc06, clc12, long = TRUE)

# Plot the contingency table
knitr::kable(ct)

```

The first two columns of the table show respectively the land cover class in year 2006 and in 2012. 
The third column shows the number of pixels (frequency). In cases where values for both column 1 and 
2 coincide then, no land cover transition occurred. On the opposite hand, different values evidence 
changes.     

We can also convert the contingency table into a confusion matrix with the following 
(not-so-pretty) code. Confusion matrices are sometimes easier to analyze than contingency 
tables... `r emo::ji("wink")`


```{r P4_convert_ct_to_cm}

# Get the class integer codes and size
lv <- unique(c(levels(ct[,1]), levels(ct[,2])))
n <- length(lv)

# Create the square confusion matrix filled with 0's
cm <- matrix(0, nrow = n, ncol = n, dimnames = list(lv,lv))

# Fill the matrix following each line of the contingency table
for(i in 1:nrow(ct)){
  cm[ct[i,1], ct[i,2]] <- ct[i,3]
}

knitr::kable(cm)

```

From either the contingency table or the matrix we can assess how much pixels remained in 
the same class, or that for some reason, changed to another land cover category. If we 
look closely into we see that several areas of forest (Class IDs 23, 24 and 25) changed to 
class ID 29 - _'Transitional woodland-shrubland'_, and, 33 - _'Burnt areas'_, thus evidencing 
forest loss.     
Using a simple rule-set, we can identify pixels that correspond to forest loss areas, identified 
by the following class transition: _2006 Class IDs {23, 24, 25} ---> 2012 Class IDs {29, 33}_


```{r P4_forest_change, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Calculate
forestLossAreas <- (clc06 %in% 23:25) & (clc12 %in% c(29,33))

# Plot the results
plot(forestLossAreas, main="Forest loss in PGNP (NW PT)", xlab="x-coord", ylab="y-coord")
plot(spTransform(maskLayer, CRS=crs(clc06)), add=TRUE)


```

The areas highlighted in green correspond to forest and/or habitat quality loss (probably due 
to wildfires...).       

This concludes our exploration of the raster package for this post. Hope you find it useful! `r emo::ji("smile")`
