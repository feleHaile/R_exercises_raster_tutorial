### Background 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the third part of this tutorial series on spatial data analysis using the `raster` package, 
we will explore more functionalities, namely:        
    
   * Masking,    
   * Aggregation,
   * Zonal analysis,
   * Cross-tabulation of two discrete/categorical datasets.

For more information on raster data processing see 
[here](http://r-exercises.com/tags/raster-data), as well as the   
[tutorial part-1](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/11/29/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-1), and, 
[tutorial part-2](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/12/13/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-2).


### Raster masking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Masking a raster is often required when we want to represent and/or analyze only the pixels included in 
a specific area/region. The remaining pixels are transformed into `NA`'s (or other user-defined value).  

For this purpose we can use the `mask` function. The mask can be either a `Raster*` object (with the 
same extent and resolution), or a `Spatial*` object (e.g., `SpatialPolygons`) in which case, all cells that 
are not covered by this object are set to `updatevalue` (set as `NA` by default).    

We will start by downloading, uncompressing and loading the sample data. A `SpatialPolygons*` layer will 
be used as the mask layer. The objective of this example is to mask elevation values that are inside 
the Peneda-Geres National Park (NW Portugal).

```{r P4_read_raster_dem, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(raster)

## Create a folder named data-raw inside the working directory to place downloaded data
if(!dir.exists("./data-raw")) dir.create("./data-raw")

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/srtm_pnpg.zip", "./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

rst <- raster("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.tif")


```


Now, let's download and read the mask layer (using `rgdal`):

```{r P4_read_masl_layer, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(sp)
library(rgdal)


## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", "./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

maskLayer <- as(readOGR(dsn = "./data-raw", layer = "pnpg_bounds"), "SpatialPolygons")


```


Plot the data to see if everything is OK:

```{r P4_plot_data}

plot(rst, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_plot_data-1.png)


Finally, let's mask the values for the Park boundaries:

```{r P4_mask_raster}

rstMasked <- mask(rst, maskLayer)

plot(rstMasked, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_mask_raster-1.png)


From the image, we can see that only pixels occurring inside the Park are represented or 'masked'.


### Raster aggregation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raster aggregation is the process of creating a new `RasterLayer` by grouping cell values in 
a rectangular area to create larger/coarser cells. This grouping can employ any user-defined function to 
summarize multiple values (in the rectangular area) and provide a single value (e.g., mean, sd, min, 
max, sum). This 'upsampling' allows to represent and analyze the spatial distribution of cell values 
inside each rectangular area.      

The `aggregate` function will be used for this purpose. The 'coarseness' of the aggregation is controlled 
by the `fact` parameter (aggregation factor) which expresses the number of cells in each direction (horizontal 
and vertical). Alternatively, two integers can be used to separately express the horizontal and vertical 
aggregation factors.      

Let's see how this works out with different aggregation factors:

    * Aggregation factor 2 - pixel size 160(m)
    * Aggregation factor 7 - pixel size 560(m)


```{r P4_raster_aggregation, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}

# Aggregation factor = 2
rstAggFact2Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = mean)
rstAggFact2SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = sd)

# Aggregation factor = 7
rstAggFact7Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = mean)
rstAggFact7SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = sd)

# Plot the newly aggregated rasters
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(rstAggFact2Mean, main = "Aggregation factor = 2 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact2SD, main = "Aggregation factor = 2 | SD")

plot(rstAggFact7Mean, main = "Aggregation factor = 7 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact7SD, main = "Aggregation factor = 7 | SD")

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_raster_aggregation-1.png)

Notice the change in coarseness as we move from an aggregation factor of 2 to 7, with much less detail in the latter. 
In this particular example (a DEM analysis), and for larger factors, it allows us to understand general landforms 
(mean) and also topographic heterogeneity (standard-deviation).


### Zonal analysis

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this part of the tutorial we will address zonal analysis. This method allows to summarize the values in a
`Raster*` object for each "zone" included in a RasterLayer (typically defined by an integer code). Applications 
include the posibility of summarizing cell values for an administrative region (like the example below) or 
calculating summary statistics for raster segments (useful in an object-based analysis approach).     

In the example we will calculate zonal statistics for elevation data for each civil parish within the 
Peneda-Geres National Park (NW Portugal).    

We start by downloading, uncompressing and loading civil parish data:

```{r P4_civil_parish_data_load, fig.width=7.5}

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", "./data-raw/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/CIVPARISH_PNPG.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

rstCivPar <- raster("./data-raw/PNPG_CivilParishes.tif")

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(rst, main="Elevation (meters)")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)
plot(rstCivPar, main="Civil parishes PNPG")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_civil_parish_data_load-1.png)


We can now calculate elevation statistics for each civil parish (identified by an 
integer number). `zonal` function accepts summaryzing functions (in argument `fun`) 
with single or multiple outputs 


```{r P4_calc_raster_zonal_stats1}

# Single-output
zonal(rst, rstCivPar, fun=mean)

```


```{r P4_calc_raster_zonal_stats2}

# Multi-output
zonal(rst, rstCivPar, fun=function(x,...) c(MED=median(x,...), MAD=mad(x,...)))

```


### Cross-tabulation of two discrete/categorical raster datasets

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Performing a cross-tabulation of two raster dataset is pretty useful when you want to assess land cover 
changes between two different dates. In this example we will Corine Land Cover (CLC; a dataset from the European 
Environmental Agency - EEA) for 2006 and 2012 to analyze changes in land cover. 
In this case we have a categorical raster with integer values corresponding to a given land cover class

```{r P4_CLC_Codes}

read.csv(url("http://some.where.net/data/foo.csv"))

```



```{r P4_load_CLC_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/CLC_06_12.zip", "./data-raw/CLC_06_12.zip", method = "auto")

unzip("./data-raw/CLC_06_12.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

# Load the Corine Land cover dataset for 2006 and 2012
clc06 <- raster("./data-raw/clc2006_100m.tif")
clc12 <- raster("./data-raw/clc2012_100m.tif")

# 'Ratify' the rasters, i.e., inform that these are categorical/discrete
clc06 <- ratify(clc06)
clc12 <- ratify(clc12)

ct <- crosstab(clc06, clc12, long = TRUE)

knitr::kable(ct)

```

From this table we can assess how much pixels remained in the same class or by some reasoned 
changed to other

We can also convert the contingency table to a confusion matrix with the following 
(not-so-pretty) code.

```{r}

# Get the class integer codes and size
lv <- unique(c(levels(ct[,1]), levels(ct[,2])))
n <- length(lv)

# Create the square confusion matrix filled with 0's
cm <- matrix(0, nrow=n, ncol=n, dimnames=list(lv,lv))

# Fill the matrix following each line of the contingency table
for(i in 1:nrow(ct)){
  cm[ct[i,1], ct[i,2]] <- ct[i,3]
}

knitr::kable(cm)

```
