### Background 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the third part of this tutorial series on spatial data analysis using the `raster` package, 
we will explore more functionalities, namely:        
    
   * Masking,    
   * Aggregation,
   * Zonal analysis and vector to raster conversion.

For more information on raster data processing see 
[here](http://r-exercises.com/tags/raster-data), as well as the   
[tutorial part-1](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/11/29/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-1), and, 
[tutorial part-2](https://www.r-exercises.com/2017/12/13/spatial-data-analysis-introduction-to-raster-processing-part-2).


### Raster masking

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Masking a raster is often required when we want to represent and/or analyze only the pixels included in 
a specific area/region. The remaining pixels are transformed into `NA`'s (or other user-defined value).  

For this purpose we can use the `mask` function. The mask can be either a `Raster*` object (with the 
same extent and resolution), or a `Spatial*` object (e.g., `SpatialPolygons`) in which case, all cells that 
are not covered by this object are set to `updatevalue` (set as `NA` by default).    

We will start by downloading, uncompressing and loading the sample data. A `SpatialPolygons*` layer will 
be used as the mask layer. The objective of this example is to mask elevation values that are inside 
the Peneda-Geres National Park (NW Portugal).

```{r P4_read_raster_dem, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(raster)

## Create a folder named data-raw inside the working directory to place downloaded data
if(!dir.exists("./data-raw")) dir.create("./data-raw")

## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/srtm_pnpg.zip", "./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", method = "auto")

## Uncompress the zip file
unzip("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

# In this example the function uses a string with the data location
rst <- raster("./data-raw/srtm_pnpg.tif")


```


Now, let's download and read the mask layer (using `rgdal`):

```{r P4_read_masl_layer, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(sp)
library(rgdal)


## If you run into download problems try changing: method = "wget"
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/data/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", "./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", method = "auto")

## Uncompress the zip file
unzip("./data-raw/BOUNDS_PNPG.zip", exdir = "./data-raw")

## Convert the data into SpatialPolygons (discards the attached attribute but keeps geometry)
maskLayer <- as(readOGR(dsn = "./data-raw", layer = "pnpg_bounds"), "SpatialPolygons")


```


Plot the data to see if everything is OK:

```{r P4_plot_data}

plot(rst, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_plot_data-1.png)


Finally, let's mask the values for the Park boundaries:

```{r P4_mask_raster}

rstMasked <- mask(rst, maskLayer)

plot(rstMasked, main="Elevation (meters) for Peneda-Geres\n National Park", xlab="X-coordinates", 
     ylab = "Y-coordinates")
plot(maskLayer, add=TRUE)

```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joaofgoncalves/R_exercises_raster_tutorial/master/img/P4_mask_raster-1.png)


From the image, we can see that only pixels occurring inside the Park are represented or 'masked'.


### Raster aggregation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Raster aggregation is the process of creating a new `RasterLayer` by grouping cell values in 
a rectangular area to create larger/coarser cells. This grouping can employ any user-defined function to 
summarize multiple values (in the rectangular area) and provide a single value (e.g., mean, sd, min, 
max, sum). This 'upsampling' allows to represent and analyze the spatial distribution of cell values 
inside each rectangular area.      

The `aggregate` function will be used for this purpose. The 'coarseness' of the aggregation is controlled 
by the `fact` parameter (aggregation factor) which expresses the number of cells in each direction (horizontal 
and vertical). Alternatively, two integers can be used to separately express the horizontal and vertical 
aggregation factors.      

Let's see how this works out with different aggregation factors:

    * Aggregation factor 2 - pixel size 160(m)
    * Aggregation factor 7 - pixel size 560(m)


```{r P4_raster_aggregation, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}

# Aggregation factor = 2
rstAggFact2Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = mean)
rstAggFact2SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 2, fun = sd)

# Aggregation factor = 7
rstAggFact7Mean <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = mean)
rstAggFact7SD <- aggregate(rst, fact = 7, fun = sd)

# Plot the newly aggregated rasters
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

plot(rstAggFact2Mean, main="Aggregation factor = 2 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact2SD, main="Aggregation factor = 2 | SD")

plot(rstAggFact7Mean, main="Aggregation factor = 7 | Mean")
plot(rstAggFact7SD, main="Aggregation factor = 7 | SD")

```

Notice the change in coarseness as we move from an aggregation factor of 2 to 7, with much less detail in the latter. 
In this particular example (a DEM analysis), and for larger factors, it allows us to understand general landforms 
(mean) and also topographic heterogeneity (standard-deviation).


### Zonal analysis and vector to raster conversion
