```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.path = "img/")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4.5, dpi = 80)

```


Geospatial data is becoming increasingly used to solve numerous 'real-life' problems (check 
out some examples [here](http://gisgeography.com/gis-applications-uses/). In turn, 
R is becoming a powerful open-source solution to handle this type of data, currently providing 
an exceptional range of functions and tools for GIS and Remote Sensing data analysis.

In particular, __raster data__ provides support for representing spatial phenomena 
by diving the surface into a grid (or matrix) composed by cells of regular size. Each raster 
dataset has a certain number of columns and rows and each cell contains a value with information 
for the variable of interest. Stored data can be either: (i) thematic - representing a 
__discrete__ variable (e.g., land cover classification map) or __continuous__ (e.g., elevation).

The `raster` package currently provides an extensive set of functions to create, read, export, 
manipulate and process raster datasets. It also provides low-level functionalities for creating 
more advanced processing chains as well as the ability to manage large datasets. For more 
information see: `vignette("functions", package = "raster")`.

In this exercise set we will explore:     

   - Masking,    
   - Aggregation,
   - Zonal analysis,
   - Cross-tabulation
   - Time-series
